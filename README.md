## Description
 - I designed a flocking simulation that represents a school of fish in the ocean. Each fish was designed as a green triangle over a yellow triangle with an ellipse for the eye. The simulation will start with 25 fish and will generate 3 more fish per frame until it reaches 50.
 
## User interaction
 - mouse left click: add more fish (up to 100)
 - S: separation feature on
 - s: separation feature off
 - C: cohesion feature on
 - c: cohesion feature off
 - A: alignment feature on
 - a: alignment feature off
 - F: 10 of the fish will follow the mouse and will disappear when then reach it (follow feature)
 - f: follow feature off
 - d: double the speed of the fish up to a maximum speed
 - h: reduce the speed of the fish by 2

## Programming language
- Processing 

## Libraries 
 - peasy: PeasyCam provides a dead-simple mouse-driven camera for Processing.
